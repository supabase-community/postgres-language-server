## Overview

This project provides a toolchain for Postgres development, built on Postgres' own parser `libpg_query` to ensure 100% syntax compatibility. It is built on a Server-Client architecture with a transport-agnostic design. This means all features can be accessed not only through the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), but also through other interfaces like a CLI, HTTP APIs, or a WebAssembly module. The goal is to make all the great Postgres tooling out there as accessible as possible, and to build anything that is missing ourselves.

Currently, the following features are implemented:
- Autocompletion
- Syntax Error Highlighting
- Type-checking (via `EXPLAIN` error insights)
- Linter, inspired by [Squawk](https://squawkhq.com)

Our current focus is on refining and enhancing these core features while building a robust and easily accessible infrastructure. For future plans and opportunities to contribute, please check out the issues and discussions. Any contributions are welcome!

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> We will update this section once we have published the binaries.

## Configuration

We recommend that you create a `postgrestools.jsonc` configuration file for each project. This eliminates the need to repeat the CLI options each time you run a command, and ensures that we use the same configuration in your editor. Some options are also only available from a configuration file. If you are happy with the defaults, you don’t need to create a configuration file. To create the `postgrestools.jsonc` file, run the `init` command in the root folder of your project:

```sh
pglt init
```

After running the `init` command, you’ll have a `postgrestools.jsonc` file in your directory:

[//]: # (BEGIN DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://supabase-community.github.io/postgres_lsp/schemas/0.0.0/schema.json",
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": false,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": false
  },
  "files": {
    "ignore": []
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "db": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "postgres",
    "database": "postgres",
    "connTimeoutSecs": 10
  }
}```

[//]: # (END DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION)

Make sure to point the database connection settings at your local development database. To see what else can be configured, run `--help`.

## Usage

You can use the language tools either via CLI or a Language Server.

The CLI exposes a simple `check` command that will run all checks on the given files or paths.

```sh
pglt check myfile.sql
```

Make sure to check out the other options. We will provide guides for specific use cases like linting migration files soon.

## Install an Editor Plugin

We recommend installing an editor plugin to get the most out of Postgres Language Tools.

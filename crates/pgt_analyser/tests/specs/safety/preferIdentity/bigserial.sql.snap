lint/safety/preferIdentity ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Prefer IDENTITY columns over SERIAL types.
  
  i Column uses 'bigserial' type which has limitations compared to IDENTITY columns.
  
  i Use 'bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY' or 'bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY' instead.

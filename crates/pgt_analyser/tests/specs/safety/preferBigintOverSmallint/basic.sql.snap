lint/safety/preferBigintOverSmallint ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × SMALLINT has a very limited range that is easily exceeded.
  
  i SMALLINT can only store values from -32,768 to 32,767. This range is often insufficient.
  
  i Consider using INTEGER or BIGINT for better range and future-proofing.

lint/safety/addSerialColumn ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Adding a column with type smallserial requires a table rewrite.

  i SERIAL types cannot be added to existing tables without a full table rewrite. Consider using a non-serial type with a sequence instead.

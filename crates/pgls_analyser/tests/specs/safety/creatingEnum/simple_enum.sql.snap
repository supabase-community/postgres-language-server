lint/safety/creatingEnum ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Creating enum type status is not recommended.
  
  i Enum types are difficult to modify: removing values requires complex migrations, and associating additional data with values is not possible.
  
  i Consider using a lookup table with a foreign key constraint instead, which provides more flexibility and easier maintenance.

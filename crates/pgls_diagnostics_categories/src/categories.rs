// This file contains the list of all diagnostic categories for the pg
// toolchain
//
// The `define_categories` macro is preprocessed in the build script for the
// crate in order to generate the static registry. The body of the macro
// consists of a list of key-value pairs defining the categories that have an
// associated hyperlink, then a list of string literals defining the remaining
// categories without a link.

// PLEASE, DON'T EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND.
// Use `just new-lintrule` to create a new rule.
// lint rules are lexicographically sorted and
// must be between `define_categories! {\n` and `\n    ;\n`.

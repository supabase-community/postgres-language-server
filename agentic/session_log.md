## Session History

---
**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Session 58)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: OpExpr, DistinctExpr, NullIfExpr, Aggref, FuncExpr, WindowFunc, SubPlan, AlternativeSubPlan, WithCheckOption, WindowClause (refactored)
**Progress**: 192/270 → 192/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Removed forbidden `emit_via_deparse` helper that was wrapping nodes in synthetic SELECT statements and calling `pgt_query::deparse()`
- Replaced all deparse round-trips with direct emission using OID placeholders for planner nodes (e.g., `op#96`, `func#123`, `agg#789`)
- Fixed WindowClause to emit directly instead of creating synthetic WindowDef nodes - copied and adapted frame emission code
- Simplified planner node emitters: OpExpr emits `a op#N b`, DistinctExpr emits `IS DISTINCT FROM`, NullIfExpr emits `NULLIF(...)`
- Updated all affected nodes to emit fallback representations directly from their fields

**Learnings**:
- **NEVER create synthetic AST nodes or wrap nodes in SELECT for deparse round-trips** - this violates the architecture
- **NEVER call `pgt_query::deparse()` from emit functions** - the pretty printer must emit directly from AST nodes
- Planner nodes (OpExpr, Aggref, etc.) represent internal optimizer structures with OIDs; simple placeholder fallbacks are acceptable
- When duplicating logic between node types, copy and adapt code directly rather than creating synthetic nodes to reuse helpers
- The pretty printer is a pure AST-to-text emitter, not a parser round-tripper

**Next Steps**:
- Continue implementing remaining nodes using direct emission patterns
- Monitor for any other instances of synthetic node creation or deparse usage
- Keep the documentation updated with architectural constraints

**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Session 57)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: FuncCall (WITHIN GROUP + FILTER)
**Progress**: 192/270 → 192/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__func_call_within_group_filter_0_60 -- --show-output
**Key Changes**:
- Extended `func_call` emission to surface `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` and `FILTER (WHERE ...)` clauses with soft breakpoints ahead of windowing.
- Added a focused single-statement fixture and snapshot covering percentile aggregates with FILTER to guard the new output.

**Learnings**:
- Ordered-set aggregates store their ordering in `agg_order`; emitting it outside the argument list keeps both surface nodes and planner fallbacks aligned.
- FILTER clauses must precede any `OVER` window to mirror parser order and preserve AST equality.

**Next Steps**:
- Backfill a multi-statement regression that exercises ordered-set aggregates with FILTER to validate planner fallbacks under the shared emitter.
- Keep auditing `func_call` for remaining gaps such as VARIADIC support once current fixtures stabilise.

**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Session 56)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: Aggref; WindowFunc
**Progress**: 190/270 → 192/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Added dedicated `aggref` and `window_func` emitters that route planner-only nodes through the shared deparse bridge with defensive fallbacks.
- Registered both nodes in `mod.rs` so planner aggregates/windows no longer hit the dispatcher `todo!()`.

**Learnings**:
- `Aggref` and `WindowFunc` reparse into `FuncCall` trees, so keeping the shared function emitter feature-complete covers planner aggregates/windows too.

**Next Steps**:
- Teach `func_call` emission to surface FILTER/WITHIN GROUP clauses so deparse fallbacks stay faithful.
- Backfill targeted fixtures that exercise aggregate FILTER and OVER clauses with the new emitters.

**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Session 55)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: FuncExpr
**Progress**: 189/270 → 190/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Added a `func_expr` emitter that deparses planner-only function nodes back into surface syntax with a guarded placeholder fallback.
- Extended the shared deparse guard so planner calls that round-trip to `FuncExpr` do not recurse indefinitely.
- Inlined the `clear_location` helper into `sqljson_debug.rs` to restore `cargo check` after integrating the debug fixture.

**Learnings**:
- The synthetic `SELECT` deparse bridge handles `FuncExpr` without additional plumbing, keeping planner expressions aligned with surface emitters.
- Integration tests that live outside `tests/tests.rs` need a local copy of structural helpers until we centralise them in a shared module.

**Next Steps**:
- Bridge `Aggref` and `WindowFunc` planner nodes through the same deparse path to cover aggregate/window fixtures.
- Deduplicate the `clear_location` helper once we deliberately rework the test harness.

**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Session 54)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: OpExpr, DistinctExpr, NullIfExpr, SubPlan, AlternativeSubPlan, WithCheckOption
**Progress**: 183/270 → 189/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Added an op_expr module that rehydrates planner-only operator nodes via libpg_query deparse before delegating back to the existing surface emitters.
- Wired SubPlan and AlternativeSubPlan through the same deparse bridge with guarded fallbacks to preserve formatting when deparse support is missing.
- Registered WithCheckOption emission so planner-enforced qualifiers no longer fall through the dispatcher.

**Learnings**:
- Wrapping planner nodes in a synthetic SELECT and round-tripping through libpg_query deparse reliably retrieves textual operators without hard-coding OID maps.
- Fallbacks should emit structurally valid SQL (even if degraded) to keep reparse checks happy when deparse cannot help.

**Next Steps**:
- Audit other planner-only nodes (e.g. FuncExpr, Alternative* wrappers) for the same deparse integration pattern.
- Consider caching the synthetic deparse ParseResult to avoid repeated allocations if performance becomes an issue.

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (Session 53)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: AlterTableCmd, FunctionParameter, WindowClause dispatch, WindowDef dispatch coverage
**Progress**: 180/270 → 183/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Exposed `emit_alter_table_cmd` and registered `NodeEnum::AlterTableCmd` so standalone ALTER TABLE commands format consistently with the aggregate statement helper.
- Promoted `emit_function_parameter` for reuse and wired `NodeEnum::FunctionParameter` into the dispatcher, aligning CREATE FUNCTION parameter rendering everywhere.
- Added a `window_clause` emitter that clones into `WindowDef` helpers and wrapped raw `WindowDef` nodes in their own layout group.

**Learnings**:
- Cloning protobuf window clauses into a temporary `WindowDef` keeps WINDOW definitions and OVER clauses in sync without duplicating frame bitmask logic.
- Many remaining planner nodes already have helper emitters embedded in statement modules; exposing them is often a matter of export + dispatcher wiring.

**Next Steps**:
- Continue wiring planner-only nodes such as `SubPlan`, `OpExpr`, and `WithCheckOption` to reduce `todo!` fallbacks.
- Investigate operator/OID lookup helpers needed for expression nodes before implementing the remaining arithmetic emitters.

**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 52)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: Enum access cleanup across GrantStmt, SecLabelStmt, TransactionStmt, InsertStmt, JoinExpr, IndexElem, CreateRoleStmt, CreateFunctionStmt, AlterObjectSchemaStmt, AlterTableStmt, MergeStmt, DefineStmt, RowExpr, AlterExtensionContentsStmt, AlterObjectDependsStmt, AlterTableMoveAllStmt, RoleSpec
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Replaced every remaining `TryFrom<i32>` conversion in node emitters with the prost-generated enum getters (`n.objtype()`, `cmd.subtype()`, etc.) to align with durable guidance and avoid silent fallbacks
- Simplified override handling in `InsertStmt` and join classification logic by leaning on typed getters; removed debug assertions that guarded integer enum misuse
- Added explicit `DropBehavior` matches where cascade handling is required so ALTER variants stay expressive without magic numbers

**Learnings**:
- Prost emits getter methods for each enum-backed field (e.g. `GrantStmt::targtype()`, `AlterTableCmd::behavior()`); using them keeps emitters concise and prevents drift when enum values change
- Auditing for leftover integer comparisons is easiest via `rg "try_from"` across `src/nodes`

**Next Steps**:
- Run `cargo clippy -p pgt_pretty_print` after the next batch of changes to ensure no regressions sneak back in
- Resume the pending WITH/RETURNING fixture integration work from Session 50 once ongoing formatting cleanups settle

**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 51)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: Code quality improvements across all emit functions
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: All clippy warnings resolved; cargo clippy -p pgt_pretty_print passes cleanly
**Key Changes**:
- Replaced all `TryFrom<i32>::try_from().ok()` patterns with direct enum method calls (`n.field()`) for cleaner, safer code
- Fixed all raw integer enum comparisons to use proper enum variants with exhaustive matching
- Added strict assertions to all SQL function emitters (EXTRACT, OVERLAY, POSITION, SUBSTRING, TRIM, NORMALIZE) to fail fast on unexpected argument counts
- Fixed all clippy warnings: collapsible_if, len_zero comparison, needless_return, needless_lifetimes
- Updated CteMaterialize enum usage to use correct variant name (CtematerializeUndefined instead of Undefined)
- Moved all session history to dedicated session_log.md file

**Learnings**:
- Protobuf-generated nodes provide direct enum accessor methods (`n.op()`, `n.action()`) that return the typed enum instead of i32
- Using these methods eliminates fallible conversions and makes the code more maintainable
- Use `assert!` (not `panic!`) for unexpected enum values and argument counts to fail fast on malformed ASTs
- Running `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` automates most style fixes, saving time
- Separating session logs from the main guide reduces clutter and makes the guide easier to navigate

**Next Steps**:
- Continue implementing remaining nodes following the updated patterns
- Consider adding more assertions to complex nodes that expect specific structures
- Run clippy regularly as part of the development loop to catch issues early
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 50)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: CommonTableExpr materialization flag; DML RETURNING + CTE fixtures
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__insert_with_cte_returning_0_60 -- --show-output; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__update_with_cte_returning_0_60 -- --show-output; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__delete_with_cte_returning_0_60 -- --show-output
**Key Changes**:
- Corrected the CTEMaterialize mapping so default CTEs no longer emit an eager MATERIALIZED hint during pretty printing.
- Added targeted single-statement fixtures covering INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with WITH ... RETURNING to isolate DML regressions from large regress suites.
- Accepted the new insta snapshots to lock in baseline formatting for the added fixtures.

**Learnings**:
- Prost enums like CteMaterialize map Default/Always/Never to 1/2/3; matching raw integers naively will leak unwanted MATERIALIZED hints.
- Focused RETURNING fixtures surfaced the enum bug quickly, confirming the value in lightweight coverage before running the full regress pack.

**Next Steps**:
- Fold the new RETURNING fixtures into routine CI runs so regressions surface alongside existing single-statement coverage.
- Proceed with the outstanding MergeStmt WHEN clause review once the broader snapshot backlog is tackled.
- Keep the INTERVAL typmod audit on deck before reopening snapshot review for type formatting.

**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 49)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: ViewStmt (persistence + options retention)
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single_view_stmt_temp_with_options_snapshot -- --show-output; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_multi__window_60 -- --show-output (still fails: unrelated legacy snapshots pending)
**Key Changes**:
- Restored TEMP/TEMPORARY/UNLOGGED persistence tokens and preserved quoted column aliases when re-emitting CREATE VIEW statements.
- Emitted WITH (options) lists and routed SelectStmt bodies through the no-semicolon helper so trailing WITH CHECK OPTION clauses land before the final semicolon.
- Added a focused single-statement fixture and snapshot covering an OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW with security_barrier + LOCAL CHECK OPTION to lock in behaviour.
**Learnings**:
- Wrapper statements that own a SelectStmt need `emit_select_stmt_no_semicolon` or downstream clauses will be stranded behind an eager semicolon.
- View options arrive as DefElem nodes; reusing the shared list helpers avoids hand-rolled quoting and keeps DDL output consistent.
**Next Steps**:
- Once the broader snapshot backlog is reviewed, rerun `test_multi__window_60` to confirm the window regression fixture now round-trips cleanly with the updated ViewStmt emitter.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 48)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: SelectStmt (WINDOW clause ordering); FuncCall (OVER clause spacing); WindowDef (frame clause breakpoints)
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_window_clause_0_60 -- --show-output; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_multi__window_60 -- --show-output (fails: ViewStmt emitter drops TEMP persistence during round-trip)
**Key Changes**:
- Reordered SelectStmt emission so WINDOW clauses now precede ORDER BY, matching parser expectations.
- Added soft-or-space breaks before OVER clauses and inside window specs to keep analytic functions within width limits.
- Expanded WindowDef frame emission with additional breakpoints so BETWEEN/AND bounds wrap cleanly without altering semantics.
**Learnings**:
- Inline window functions need soft break opportunities both before OVER and between frame keywords to satisfy 60-column fixtures.
- Frame clauses still expose latent ViewStmt regression once width issues are solved; persistence flags are being stripped during formatting.
**Next Steps**:
- Restore ViewStmt persistence/alias emission so window regression stops diffing now that clause ordering is fixed.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 47)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: WindowDef (frame clauses and exclusion handling)
**Progress**: 180/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_window_clause_0_60 -- --show-output; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_multi__window_60 -- --show-output (fails: ORDER BY precedes WINDOW)
**Key Changes**:
- Mapped window frame option bitmasks to RANGE/ROWS/GROUPS output with correct BETWEEN/AND bounds and PRECEDING/FOLLOWING modifiers.
- Guarded PRECEDING/FOLLOWING emission on the presence of start/end offsets and added EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW/GROUP/TIES rendering.
**Learnings**:
- Postgres sets `FRAMEOPTION_NONDEFAULT` whenever frame bits or exclusions are present, so decoding the bitmask is enough to decide when to render the clause.
- Offset-based bounds always carry nodes; asserting their presence prevents silent mis-formatting when the planner omits them.
**Next Steps**:
- Fix SelectStmt clause ordering so WINDOW clauses emit before ORDER BY and rerun the window regression fixture to verify round-tripping.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 46)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: SelectStmt (DISTINCT/DISTINCT ON, WINDOW clause, locking clause support); LockingClause; WindowDef (named window references)
**Progress**: 179/270 → 180/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_distinct_0_60; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_distinct_on_0_60; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_window_clause_0_60; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_for_update_0_60
**Key Changes**:
- Added a dedicated `emit_locking_clause` and wired SelectStmt to surface `FOR UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE` clauses after LIMIT/OFFSET.
- Extended SelectStmt emission with DISTINCT/DISTINCT ON handling and inlined window clause definitions, reusing a richer WindowDef printer.
- Created focused fixtures exercising DISTINCT ON, WINDOW definitions, and SKIP LOCKED to lock down the new output.

**Learnings**:
- `distinct_clause` signals plain DISTINCT via a single null node, while DISTINCT ON provides actual expressions that need explicit `ON (...)` rendering.
- Named windows surface through `WindowDef.name`; treating empty specs as references preserves `OVER w` while still supporting full clause emission.

**Next Steps**:
- Flesh out window frame emission once the frame_option bitmasks are mapped so RANGE/ROWS clauses round-trip.
- Revisit existing `.snap.new` fixtures once broader snapshot review is scheduled to avoid conflating unrelated diffs.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 45)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: TypeName (INTERVAL typmods)
**Progress**: 179/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__type_name_interval_0_60 -- --show-output
**Key Changes**:
- Decoded INTERVAL typmods in `emit_type_name` so range masks render as `YEAR`, `DAY TO SECOND`, and other canonical phrases.
- Guarded the fallback path once the mask is recognised to keep raw typmod integers from leaking into formatted output.
- Added a focused single-statement fixture covering INTERVAL combinations and captured the snapshot.

**Learnings**:
- Interval masks reuse the `dt.h` bit positions; interpreting `typmods[0]` restores the `*_TO_*` wording before we emit precision.
- Precision arrives as `typmods[1]` only when present, and skipping the full-precision sentinel avoids redundant parentheses.

**Next Steps**:
- Spot-check CAST/DEFAULT expressions that use INTERVAL typmods so the new layout does not introduce regressions in outstanding snapshots.
- Fold any incidental diffs from the updated TypeName logic into the planned snapshot review batch to keep `.snap.new` files organised.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Session 44)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: TypeName (built-in normalization)
**Progress**: 179/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__create_table_simple_0_60; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__type_cast_0_60
**Key Changes**:
- Normalized built-in TypeName variants to emit canonical SQL keywords and drop redundant `pg_catalog` qualifiers while preserving user schemas.
- Added `%TYPE` emission support and a shared helper for dot-separated identifiers to keep quoting consistent.

**Learnings**:
- Restrict builtin normalization to known schema-qualified names so `public.int4` stays explicit while `pg_catalog.int4` becomes `INT`.

**Next Steps**:
- Backfill INTERVAL typmod decoding so duration precision formatting resumes matching legacy snapshots.
- Re-run multi snapshot review after interval handling to confirm no remaining TypeName regressions.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 43)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: DeleteStmt; UpdateStmt; MergeStmt (WITH clause)
**Progress**: 179/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Wired DeleteStmt to emit WITH, USING, WHERE, and RETURNING clauses using shared list helpers and soft-or-space breakpoints.
- Extended UpdateStmt with WITH, FROM, and RETURNING coverage so multi-table updates share the INSERT layout strategy.
- Enabled MergeStmt to surface leading WITH clauses via `emit_with_clause`, clearing the lingering TODO for CTEs.

**Learnings**:
- Soft-or-space breakpoints keep DML clauses compact when short but gracefully wrap once USING/FROM lists grow.
- Reusing the generic comma-separated list helper prevents spacing drift between RETURNING lists across INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.

**Next Steps**:
- Capture targeted fixtures for DELETE/UPDATE WITH + RETURNING combinations before sweeping snapshot review.
- Spot-check MergeStmt WHEN clause layout against the new DML output to ensure group boundaries stay consistent.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 42)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: InsertStmt (WITH, OVERRIDING, RETURNING)
**Progress**: 179/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Added WITH clause emission so CTE-backed INSERTs preserve their leading WITH groups.
- Decoded `OverridingKind` to emit OVERRIDING SYSTEM/USER VALUE tokens in the right slot.
- Emitted RETURNING lists with soft line breaks for consistency with UPDATE/MERGE output.

**Learnings**:
- Insert's `override` flag maps cleanly through `OverridingKind::try_from`, keeping unexpected planner values obvious via debug assertions.

**Next Steps**:
- Mirror the RETURNING/CTE handling in `UpdateStmt` and `DeleteStmt` to close out shared DML gaps.
- Audit `MergeStmt` to wire up its pending WITH clause now that the helper path is proven.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 42)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: SelectStmt FETCH WITH TIES limit handling
**Progress**: 179/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_fetch_with_ties_0_60 -- --nocapture; cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print test_single__select_fetch_first_0_60 -- --nocapture
**Key Changes**:
- Emitted `FETCH FIRST … ROWS WITH TIES` when `limit_option` reports `LimitOption::WithTies`, keeping the limit semantics round-trippable.
- Added single-statement fixtures exercising `FETCH FIRST` (with and without WITH TIES) so the formatter output stays covered.

**Learnings**:
- `LimitOption::WithTies` is the lone discriminator for FETCH syntax; everything else should keep emitting classic LIMIT/OFFSET to avoid churn in existing snapshots.

**Next Steps**:
- Expand multi-statement fixtures that mix FETCH WITH TIES and locking clauses to confirm clause ordering holds up.
- Review whether OFFSET output should pluralise ROW/ROWS based on literal values before widening coverage.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 41)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: InferClause; OnConflictClause
**Progress**: 177/270 → 179/270
**Tests**: cargo check -p pgt_pretty_print
**Key Changes**:
- Added a dedicated `emit_infer_clause` so ON CONFLICT targets handle both column lists and constraint references with shared WHERE emission.
- Reworked `emit_on_conflict_clause` to use keyword token kinds, reuse `emit_set_clause`, and guard action decoding via `TryFrom`.
- Registered the new node in `mod.rs` so InsertStmt dispatch no longer falls through to the global `todo!` on ON CONFLICT inputs.

**Learnings**:
- Prost enums expose fallible `TryFrom<i32>` which keeps us off deprecated helpers and makes unexpected planner values obvious.

**Next Steps**:
- Finish the remaining `InsertStmt` TODOs (RETURNING clause, WITH support) now that ON CONFLICT formatting is wired up.
- Add targeted fixtures covering `ON CONSTRAINT` usage and partial index predicates to exercise the new emitters.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 40)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: CoerceToDomain; CoerceToDomainValue; FieldSelect; FieldStore
**Progress**: 173/270 → 177/270
**Tests**: `cargo test -p pgt_pretty_print` (expected snapshot churn; 146/270 passing)
**Key Changes**:
- Added pass-through emitters for CoerceToDomain, FieldSelect, and FieldStore so wrapper nodes no longer trigger dispatcher `todo!` panics.
- Emitted the VALUE keyword for CoerceToDomainValue to unblock domain constraint formatting.
- Registered the new emitters in `src/nodes/mod.rs` so the dispatcher recognises them.

**Learnings**:
- Wrapper nodes that only exist to enforce domain semantics should defer to their inner expressions to preserve layout and avoid redundant tokens.

**Next Steps**:
- Resume TypeName normalisation work to stabilise built-in type output before snapshot review.
- Audit remaining wrapper-style nodes (e.g. SubscriptingRef assignment) that still fall through to `todo!`.
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 39)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: ArrayCoerceExpr; CoerceViaIo; ConvertRowtypeExpr; RelabelType; RowCompareExpr; RowExpr implicit tuples
**Progress**: 168/270 → 173/270
**Tests**: 1 targeted (row_compare_expr) passes; bulk snapshot review still outstanding
**Key Changes**:
- Added pass-through emitters for CoerceViaIo, ArrayCoerceExpr, ConvertRowtypeExpr, and RelabelType so implicit casts defer to their inner node
- Implemented RowCompareExpr formatting with tuple grouping and operator tokens
- Updated RowExpr to respect implicit tuple form and surface optional column aliases without forcing ROW keyword

**Learnings**:
- Use `CoercionForm::CoerceImplicitCast` to decide when a row constructor should omit the `ROW` keyword to preserve the original AST shape
- RowCompareExpr carries row-wise operator metadata; mapping that enum directly to tokens keeps comparisons symmetric

**Next Steps**:
- Normalize TypeName output for built-in catalog types so snapshots stop oscillating between schema-qualified and canonical names
- Implement remaining coercion wrappers (CoerceToDomain, FieldSelect/FieldStore) that still fall through to `todo!`
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 38)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: JoinExpr (line breaking); ObjectWithArgs (operator spacing)
**Progress**: 168/270 → 168/270
**Tests**: 0 passed (was 0) — `test_multi__alter_operator_60` now requires snapshot review
**Key Changes**:
- Added soft breaks around join keywords and qualifiers so ON clauses respect the 60-column limit without forcing ragged joins
- Emitted symbolic operator names without quoting and forced a separating space before argument lists to keep DROP/ALTER syntax parseable

**Learnings**:
- Soft lines before join segments give the renderer flexibility to fall back to multi-line layouts when predicates are long
- Operator names composed purely of punctuation must stay bare and include an explicit space before parentheses

**Next Steps**:
- Review `tests__alter_operator_60.snap.new` via `cargo insta review`
- Spot-check other join-heavy statements for consistent wrapping before re-running broader suites
---
---
**Date**: 2025-10-17 (Session 37)
**Nodes Implemented/Fixed**: AlterOperatorStmt; AExpr operator forms; DefineStmt (operator support)
**Progress**: 167/270 → 168/270
**Tests**: 0 passed (was 0) — `test_multi__alter_operator_60` still fails on legacy long lines
**Key Changes**:
- Added explicit operator emitters for CREATE/ALTER OPERATOR and extended AExpr handling for qualified operators and NOT variants
- Relaxed identifier quoting using a reserved keyword allowlist and preserved schema-aware type names while improving function parameter layout
**Learnings**:
- Operator names need bespoke rendering (no quoting, optional schema qualifiers) and SET option payloads mix lists, typenames, and sentinel NONE values
- Reserved keywords are the inflection point for quoting; unreserved keywords like `name` should remain bare to match snapshot expectations
**Next Steps**:
- Address remaining line-length regressions in legacy SELECT formatting before re-running the multi-suite
- Expand AlterOperatorStmt to cover MERGES/HASHES boolean toggles without string fallbacks once layout is sorted
